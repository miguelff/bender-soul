#bender-brain-ws#

This toy project is a simple HTTP endpoint to conversate with an AI

The real brain in Bender is [my simplified fork](https://github.com/miguelff/program-ab/tree/lite-0.0.1) of [program-ab] (https://code.google.com/p/program-ab/), the AI behind [Alice the bot](http://www.pandorabots.com/pandora/talk).

I have made this to give a soul to bender, which is the [hubot](http://hubot.github.com/) we have at [BeBanjo](http://www.bebanjo.com).
